Midori is a lightweight yet powerful web browser which runs just as well on little embedded computers named for delicious pastries as it does on beefy machines with a core temperature exceeding that of planet earth. And it looks good doing that, built on top of <code>Electron</code> and <code>React</code>. It aims to be fast, private, beautiful, extensible and functional.

# FAQ

## Why Electron?
<div style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
<p>
Midori Browser has been hated by many people for using Electron by saying things like it's a web browser inside a web browser.

It's somewhat true, but technically it doesn't matter (also please keep in mind that browsers like Firefox also have the UI built with web technologies). It doesn't make the browser any slower or heavier, it's rather the opposite based on Midori Browser resources usage compared to Chrome.

Choosing Electron was the best option to build the browser. We can build the UI however we want and make the customization even better. We don't have enough resources to build Chromium for weeks and edit almost 25 million lines of code and search for weeks for example the code responsible for changing button icons. Instead we chose Electron which uses only several Chromium components required to properly display the external content without any of the Google services, which makes the browser much lighter. Despite using only some part of Chromium, it doesn't really affect on the browser functionalities. We can implement all of the Chromium features except the Google services.

This Midori renovation uses Wexond as a base but little by little it will be integrating many new innovations, thanks to Mert GÃ¶r.
