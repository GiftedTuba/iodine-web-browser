  <h1>Iodine Browser</h1> 

Iodine is a cool, modern web browser of the future that runs just as well on little embedded computers named for delicious pastries as it does on beefy machines with a core temperature exceeding that of planet earth. And it looks good doing that, built on top of <code>Electron</code> and <code>React</code>. It aims to be fast, private, beautiful, extensible and functional.
